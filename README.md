# C17 Tutorial for Beginners

Welcome to the C17 Tutorial for Beginners! This repository is designed to help beginners learn and practice C programming in a structured and practical way. It contains a collection of code examples and exercises based on the book "C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd Edition" by K.N. King - a highly recommended resource for anyone looking to understand the fundamentals of C programming.

## About This Repository
The code in this repository is tailored for beginners and includes practical questions and exercises that cover various aspects of C programming. Each file in the repository is a standalone example that demonstrates a specific concept or technique in C, making it easy for learners to follow along and practice coding skills at their own pace.

## Getting Started
To get started with the tutorials and exercises in this repository, you'll need:

- A basic understanding of programming concepts.
- A C compiler installed on your computer. GCC, Clang, and MSVC are popular choices.
- An editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or CLion).

## Example: Caesar Cipher

One of the practical code questions included in this repository is the implementation of the Caesar Cipher - a simple encryption technique. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

`void Julius_Caesar_code() {
    #define MAX_SIZE 1000
    
    int i, shifter; // Loop counter and shift amount.
    unsigned char message[MAX_SIZE]; // Array to hold the input message.

    // Ask for and read the message to encrypt.
    printf("Enter the message to be encrypted: ");
    fgets(message, MAX_SIZE, stdin);

    // Ask for and read the number of positions to shift.
    printf("Enter shift amount: ");
    scanf("%d", &shifter);
    
    // Start encrypting and printing the message.
    printf("Encrypted message: ");
    for (i = 0; message[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        if (message[i] >= 'a' && message[i] <= 'z') {
            printf("%c", ((message[i] - 'a' + shifter) % 26) + 'a');
        } else if (message[i] >= 'A' && message[i] <= 'Z') {
            printf("%c", ((message[i] - 'A' + shifter) % 26) + 'A');
        } else {
            printf("%c", message[i]);
        }
    }
}`

This example demonstrates how to apply a simple encryption technique to a string of text. It's a great way to practice working with strings, loops, and conditional statements in C.
